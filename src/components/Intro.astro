      Hello, I am Vangmay (Waang-maye), an undergraduate student at National University of Singapore. 
      Welcome to my <span class="highlight">digital homepage</span>. 
      I like to learn new things in the field of computing and often dive 
      into a deep rabbit hole to learn more about different concepts so 
      I made this website to allow me to share some of these things. 
      I enjoy tackling projects that push me out of my comfort zone and serve as an opportunity to learn new things! 
      I also enjoy teaching others about topics that I find interesting and discussing about them, so feel free to reach out üëã. 
    </p>

    <Heading as="h1"class="">About Me</Heading>
    <p>
      My love for computer science began when I encountered visual basics during classes in middle school 
      and started tinkering around with it and making random projects like quizzes,games using the software. 
      I started to dive deep inside the rabbit hole of programming, computer science and artificial intelligence. 
      What I love the most about the subject is its ability of simulate intelligence using mathematics. 
      I also admire how well computer science is able to work with other disciplines to solve domain specific problems. 
    </p>
    <Heading as="h1"class="">Programming</Heading>
    <p>
      I like to spend my time writing code and getting to learn new things.  
      My favourite programming language is <a class="animated" href = "https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, majorly 
      because of how convenient it is to use libraries such as <a class = "animated" href = "https://pytorch.org/">Pytorch</a> and <a class = "animated" href = "https://www.tensorflow.org">TensorFlow</a>. 
      I enjoy working with Javascript, <a class = "animated" href = "https://nextjs.org/">Next.Js</a> is my go-to 
      framework because of its features such as dynamic routing. 
    </p>  
    <p>
      Besides that, I like to try out different programming languages which has 
      led me to be familiar with alot of them like 
      <span class="highlight"> Java, C, C++, Haskell and OCaml </span>. 
      Besides that, I also try out different domains of programming such as Frontend, Backend, Artificial Intelligence and Compiler Development. 
      I love to break open modern abstractions and figure out how things works underneath the syntactic sugar. 
    </p>
    <Heading as="h1"class="">Teaching and Hackathons</Heading>
    <p>
      Before leaving for University, I helped organise the first high-schooler-led hackathon in my city, 
      CodeDay Lucknow. It was pretty cool. I got to mentor people for workshops and also conduct one myself. 
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Later on, I flew to Bengluru to participate in CodeDay Bengluru.  
      It was a fun experience, I pulled off my third all-nighter and also conducted a workshop on AI to 
      help attendees understand when it means when we talk about "Training a neural network".

    </p>
    <Heading as="h1"class="">Books and Movies</Heading>
    <p> 
      Many of my favourite films are by the filmmaker Wes Anderson, for me his films are an escape from reality. 
      I really like his style of bright colours and also the comedic feel it brings into his stories. 
      Some of my favourite films are <a class="animated" href = "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14039582/">Drive my car</a>, <a class = "animated" href = "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099685/">Goodfellas</a>, <a class = "animated" href = "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9243804/">The green knight</a> and Star Wars (Sequel and Prequel triologies)</a>. 
      The book I read are sometimes fiction, sometimes Science and also philosophy. 
      Currently I am reading <span class="highlight"> The Problems of Philosophy by Bertrand Russel </span>.  
      <!-- <Book title = "1984" author = "George Orwell" imagePath = {redBook} /> -->

    <Heading as="h1"class="">Other stuff</Heading>
    <p>
      I enjoy playing chess, currently I am rated 978 in <a href = "chess.com">chess.com</a>   
      I did kendo this year and found it to be super fun. Also this year, I experienced the taste of 5 different cuisines, 
      attended my first concert and learned how to play mahjong and now I enjoy playing it with friends :)
